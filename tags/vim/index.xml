      <description>I really like the &amp;ldquo;Fira Code&amp;rdquo; font but it always looked nasty in gVim on Windows (my main text editor besides VS), and I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to use a different font for each editor. After spending literally hours fiddling with stuff like the guifont setting, different font/size combos, custom font renderers (e.g. MacType), I finally realised the fonts themselves aren&amp;rsquo;t the problem, nor the rendering settings. The problem was that the chocolatey installer I had used installed OTF versions of the files, which gVim always used by default even if the TTF versions of them were installed.</description>
