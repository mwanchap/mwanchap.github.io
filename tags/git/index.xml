      <description>We had a git repo with hundreds of already-merged branches which I wanted to clean up. They&amp;rsquo;d all been merged via &amp;ldquo;squash merges&amp;rdquo;, meaning there was no merge commit to easily link back to the source branches. I wanted to delete these unnecessary branches, but only the ones that had definitely already been merged into the master branch via a pull request (PR). Below is how I used the Azure Devops CLI to get a list of them.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to clean up some long-lived branches in our repo and came across this handy stackoverflow post to get branches by the date of the commit they branched from.
I&amp;rsquo;ve modified it slightly to be easier to use for my purposes:
git show-ref | { while read branch; do merge_base=$(git merge-base &amp;ndash;all $branch master); date_branched=$(git show -s &amp;ndash;format=format:&amp;quot;%cd %an&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;date=short $merge_base); echo &amp;ldquo;$date_branched, $branch&amp;rdquo;; done } | sort</description>
