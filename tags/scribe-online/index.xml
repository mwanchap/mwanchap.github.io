      <description>Today we encountered a weird problem after resetting the credentials for the Salesforce account used for synchronising data. Although the &amp;ldquo;Test Connection&amp;rdquo; was successful, any attempts to connect to Salesforce ended up with this error: &amp;ldquo;Destination URL not reset. The URL returned from login must be set in the SforceService SOQL&amp;rdquo; Which really doesn&amp;rsquo;t help much; Googling for it just turns up a bunch of info about Salesforce API connections, so hopefully someone having the same issue finds this post.</description>
